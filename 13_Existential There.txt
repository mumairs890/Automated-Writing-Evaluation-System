FRAMEWORK/CRITERIA:
[FRAMEWORK]
<ErrorTypes>
  <MainType name="Existential There" description="If an error involves the misuse of 'there' in existential constructions, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged.">
    <SubType name="There Error" description="If 'there' is used in a way that fails to correctly introduce an existence statement, or is omitted when necessary for such statements, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. Specifically, this tag should be applied if 'there' is used with the wrong verb form, with quantifiers or modifiers that do not agree grammatically, or is replaced by or replaced with other locative adverbs inappropriately. Examples of errors include missing 'there' where required, using 'there' with plural nouns but singular verbs, incorrect adverb replacement, and faulty quantifier usage that leads to a grammatical mismatch.">

Prompt:
    As an expert in English and Computer Science, interpret the provided XML framework or criteria and analyze the structured user input given as JSON. The JSON will contain a key-value pair with "line_number" as a line number, and "sentence" as the corresponding English input text. The text within the JSON is interconnected.
    Using the classification tags from the provided framework, apply all relevant tags to the JSON. You must accurately tag the sentences, identifying and assigning appropriate SubTypes for the MainType. Additionally, for every tag you apply, provide a detailed justification, explaining why each specific tag was chosen.

    Required actions :
    Tagging: "Using the provided criteria file or framework, begin by understanding the MainType outlined. Then, review the description of MainType and its associated SubTypes. Based on these descriptions, assign the appropriate MainType and SubType to each sentence. Some sentences may require multiple SubType tags, so ensure that all relevant tags are applied accurately. Stick strictly to the given FRAMEWORK and focus exclusively on identifying and tagging major errors. Do not offer any suggestions or corrections, just focus solely on tagging major errors."

    Rules for analysis: 
    "If a sentence does not fit any of the MainType and SubType, or if it contains errors that are not addressed by the established criteriaâ€”such as minor errors that do not significantly disrupt the overall meaning or the minor errors that only effect the clarity or conciseness of the sentence then you must write only "NONE" for both MainType and SubType. The aim is to ensure that only relevant major errors are identified and tagged for analysis."

    Justification: "Provide a detailed justification for each tag, explaining why a specific SubType has been applied. Clarify the reasons for tagging each sentence according to the provided criteria, ensuring that the rationale for selecting the particular SubType must be clear and logical. Justification must be according to the provided SubTypeTag and provide correction of SubTypeTag error as well in justification. If their is "NONE" in both MainType and SubType then you must write only "NONE" in Justification."

    Required output :
    The output must be structure as following CSV. Each opening CSV tag should close with proper closing tag.
