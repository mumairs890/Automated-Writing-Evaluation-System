FRAMEWORK/CRITERIA:
[FRAMEWORK]
<ErrorTypes>
    <MainType name="NOUN" description="If errors involve the form or usage of nouns that impair grammatical accuracy, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged.
First of all check the errored word is a NOUN or NOT using given conditions. If the errored word is NOUN and is used incorrectly then assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. 
Conditions:

1. If a word can directly follow a determiner (e.g., the, a, an, this, that, my, our) or a quantity word (some, many, few) and form a valid phrase (e.g., “the car,” “my idea,” “some information”),
then that word is functioning as a noun. (Note: Proper nouns often appear without articles or determiners, but they still fulfill the role of a noun.)

2. If a word regularly forms a plural (by -s or irregular means, e.g., “cats,” “children,” “geese”) or can take a possessive (’s or s’), then that word is functioning as a noun (e.g., “the cat’s tail,” “children’s toys”). (Uncountable nouns may not pluralize, but those that do are almost always nouns.)

3. If a single word can serve as the subject of a verb (e.g., “Books are heavy,” “London is busy”) or the object of a verb/preposition (e.g., “We read books,” “I live in London”), then it is functioning as a noun in that position.

4. If a word stands for or names a person (e.g., “teacher,” “John”), place (e.g., “city,” “Paris”), thing (“table,” “phone”), or abstract concept (“happiness,” “time”), then it is functioning as a noun.

5. If a word is conventionally recognized as a proper name for a person, location, organization, event, or brand (e.g., “Google,” “Christmas,” “Harvard,” “Sarah”), then it is functioning as a noun (specifically, a proper noun).

How to Apply These Rules
Check the syntactic frame: Does the word appear after a determiner? Can it take plural or possessive forms?
Check the semantic reference: Is it naming a concrete or abstract entity?
Check the grammatical role: Is it serving as the subject, direct object, or prepositional object?
If the word meets one or more of these fixed conditions in context, it is functioning as a noun.">


        <SubType name="Noun Usage Error" 
                 description="If an error involves the incorrect usage of any noun type—common (e.g., cat, book), proper (e.g., London, John), countable (e.g., apple, chair), uncountable (e.g., advice, information), abstract (e.g., love, courage), or collective (e.g., team, family)—in a way that disrupts grammatical correctness, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged.">
            <Example>Incorrect: "She moved to new york." Correct: "She moved to New York."</Example>
            <Example>Incorrect: "There are many apple on the table."</Example>
            <Example>Correct: "There are many apples on the table."</Example>
            <Example>Incorrect: "She showed great courages."</Example>
            <Example>Correct: "She showed great courage."</Example>
        </SubType>

        <SubType name="Plural Form" 
                 description="If an error involves only the incorrect pluralization of nouns—whether by adding or omitting 's/es' where needed, misusing irregular plural forms (e.g., child → children), or pluralizing uncountable nouns (e.g., advices, informations)—assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged.">
            <Example>Incorrect: "She has two childs."</Example>
            <Example>Correct: "She has two children."</Example>
            <Example>Incorrect: "He caught five fishs in the lake."</Example>
            <Example>Correct: "He caught five fish in the lake."</Example>
        </SubType>

        <SubType name="Possessive Form" 
                 description="If an error involves only the incorrect use of the possessive form—such as omitting or misplacing the apostrophe in singular (e.g., John's) or plural (e.g., students') nouns—assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged.">
            <Example>Incorrect: "That is Johns book."</Example>
            <Example>Correct: "That is John's book."</Example>
            <Example>Incorrect: "The students room is on the left."</Example>

Prompt:
    As an expert in English and Computer Science, interpret the provided XML FRAMEWORK or criteria and analyze the structured user input given as JSON. The JSON will contain a key-value pair with "line_number" as a line number, and "sentence" as the corresponding English input text. The text within the JSON is interconnected.
    Using the classification tags from the provided FRAMEWORK, apply all relevant tags to the JSON. You must accurately tag the sentences, identifying and assigning appropriate SubTypes for the MainType. Additionally, for every tag you apply, provide a detailed justification, explaining why each specific tag was chosen.

    Required actions :
    Tagging: "Using the provided criteria file or FRAMEWORK, begin by understanding the MainType outlined. Then, review the description of MainType and its associated SubTypes. Based on these descriptions, assign the appropriate MainType and SubType to each sentence. Some sentences may require multiple SubType tags, so ensure that all relevant tags are applied accurately. Stick strictly to the given FRAMEWORK and focus exclusively on identifying and tagging major errors. Do not offer any suggestions or corrections, just focus solely on tagging major errors."

    Rules for analysis: 
    "If a sentence does not fit any of the MainType and SubType, or if it contains errors that are not addressed by the established criteria—such as minor errors that do not significantly disrupt the overall meaning or the minor errors that only effect the clarity or conciseness of the sentence then you must write only "NONE" for both MainType and SubType. The aim is to ensure that only relevant major errors are identified and tagged for analysis."

    Justification: "Provide a detailed justification for each tag, explaining why a specific SubType has been applied. Clarify the reasons for tagging each sentence according to the provided criteria, ensuring that the rationale for selecting the particular SubType must be clear and logical. Justification must be according to the provided SubTypeTag and provide correction of SubTypeTag error as well in justification. Also output Correction of errors as 'Correction:'. If their is "NONE" in both MainType and SubType then you must write only "NONE" in Justification."

    Required output :
    The output must be structure as following CSV. Each opening CSV tag should close with proper closing tag.
