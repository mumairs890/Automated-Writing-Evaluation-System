<ErrorTypes>
    <MainType name="PREPOSITION" description="If an error involves the misuse of a prepositional phrase leading to a disruption in accurately linking sentence elements or specifying relationships of space, time, condition, or manner, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged.
First of all check the errored word is a PROFORM or NOT using given conditions. If the errored word is PROFORM and is used incorrectly then assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. 
Conditions:

1. If a word (e.g., “in,” “at,” “on,” “to,” “from,” “by,” “with,” “under,” “over,” “about,” etc.) appears directly before a noun, pronoun, or gerund (e.g., “walking”) and together they form a phrase (e.g., “in the house,” “by them,” “to walking class”), then that word is functioning as a preposition. In other words, it takes an object (noun/pronoun/gerund), creating a “prepositional phrase.”

2. If a word expresses a relational meaning (e.g., location, direction, time, manner, cause, possession) and governs a following noun phrase to show “where,” “when,” “how,” or “why” something is happening, then it is a preposition. Example: “Under the bridge” → relationship of place; “During the meeting” → relationship of time.

3. If the same word that might otherwise introduce a clause (e.g., “before,” “after,” “since,” “until”) instead introduces only a noun phrase (not a full clause) in this usage (e.g., “before lunch,” “since yesterday”), then it is a preposition. (By contrast, “before we eat” introduces a subordinate clause and before can function as a subordinating conjunction, not a preposition.) Object Omission Test

4. If removing the word plus its accompanying noun phrase (object) from the sentence removes a modifier (e.g., time, place, manner) but leaves the main structure otherwise intact, then that word was functioning as a preposition within a prepositional phrase. Known Prepositional Set

5. If a word is commonly recognized as part of the closed set of typical English prepositions (“at,” “by,” “for,” “from,” “in,” “of,” “on,” “to,” “with,” “about,” etc.) and it directly takes an object, then it is a preposition in that usage.

Key Reminder
Many words labeled as “prepositions” can also function as adverbs or conjunctions depending on context. For example, “up” is a preposition in “up the stairs,” but an adverb in “stand up.” Always check whether it has a noun phrase following it and whether that phrase functions as a unit of meaning (a prepositional phrase) indicating some kind of relationship. If so, it’s acting as a preposition.">

        <SubType name="General Preposition" description="If an error involves the misuse of a basic, single-word preposition (e.g., in, on, at, by, with, under, over, between, during, through) that results in a logical, temporal, or spatial disconnect within the sentence, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. This subtype targets errors where the simple preposition used does not align with the required context or sentence structure, affecting the coherence of the text.">
            <Example>Incorrect: 'They discussed about the problem.'</Example>
            <Example>Correct: 'They discussed the problem.'</Example>
            <Example>Incorrect: 'She was married with him for twenty years.'</Example>
            <Example>Correct: 'She was married to him for twenty years.'</Example>
        </SubType>
        <SubType name="Phrasal Preposition" description="If an error involves the incorrect use of a complex, multi-word prepositional phrase (e.g., in front of, in accordance with, on behalf of, according to, due to, close to, next to, prior to, as opposed to, instead of) that causes confusion or inaccuracies in representing spatial, temporal, or logical relationships, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. This subtype addresses errors where the phrasal preposition used leads to an unclear or incorrect sentence structure, thus impairing the clarity or intent of the statement.">
            <Example>Incorrect: 'The chair is placed front of the table.'</Example>
            <Example>Correct: 'The chair is placed in front of the table.'</Example>
            <Example>Incorrect: 'She completed the project according to the incorrect guidelines.'</Example>
            <Example>Correct: 'She completed the project in accordance with the correct guidelines.'</Example>

Prompt:
    As an expert in English and Computer Science, interpret the provided XML FRAMEWORK or criteria and analyze the structured user input given as JSON. The JSON will contain a key-value pair with "line_number" as a line number, and "sentence" as the corresponding English input text. The text within the JSON is interconnected.
    Using the classification tags from the provided FRAMEWORK, apply all relevant tags to the JSON. You must accurately tag the sentences, identifying and assigning appropriate SubTypes for the MainType. Additionally, for every tag you apply, provide a detailed justification, explaining why each specific tag was chosen.

    Required actions :
    Tagging: "Using the provided criteria file or FRAMEWORK, begin by understanding the MainType outlined. Then, review the description of MainType and its associated SubTypes. Based on these descriptions, assign the appropriate MainType and SubType to each sentence. Some sentences may require multiple SubType tags, so ensure that all relevant tags are applied accurately. Stick strictly to the given FRAMEWORK and focus exclusively on identifying and tagging major errors. Do not offer any suggestions or corrections, just focus solely on tagging major errors."

    Rules for analysis: 
    "If a sentence does not fit any of the MainType and SubType, or if it contains errors that are not addressed by the established criteria—such as minor errors that do not significantly disrupt the overall meaning or the minor errors that only effect the clarity or conciseness of the sentence then you must write only "NONE" for both MainType and SubType. The aim is to ensure that only relevant major errors are identified and tagged for analysis."

    Justification: "Provide a detailed justification for each tag, explaining why a specific SubType has been applied. Clarify the reasons for tagging each sentence according to the provided criteria, ensuring that the rationale for selecting the particular SubType must be clear and logical. Justification must be according to the provided SubTypeTag and provide correction of SubTypeTag error as well in justification. Also output Correction of errors as 'Correction:'. If their is "NONE" in both MainType and SubType then you must write only "NONE" in Justification."

    Required output :
    The output must be structure as following CSV. Each opening CSV tag should close with proper closing tag.
