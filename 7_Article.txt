FRAMEWORK/CRITERIA:
[FRAMEWORK]
<ErrorTypes>
  <MainType name="ARTICLE" description="If an error involves the misuse or incorrect form of an article, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged.
First of all check the errored word is a PROFORM or NOT using given conditions. If the errored word is PROFORM and is used incorrectly then assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. 
Conditions:
1. If the word is the and it precedes a noun or noun phrase (singular or plural) in order to refer to something specific or previously mentioned, then it is an article. Example: “The book on the table,” “The stars in the sky,” “The issue we discussed.”

2. If the word is a and it precedes a singular, countable noun (or noun phrase) that begins with a consonant sound (e.g., “a dog,” “a university”), then it is an article.

3. If the word is an and it precedes a singular, countable noun (or noun phrase) that begins with a vowel sound (e.g., “an apple,” “an hour”), then it is an article.
Key Points
English has only three widely recognized articles: the (definite) and a/an (indefinite).
Articles typically appear directly before a noun or its modifiers (e.g., “the big house,” “an excellent idea,” “a broken toy”).
The choice between a and an depends on the sound that immediately follows, not just the letter.">


    <SubType name="Definite Article" description="If the error involves the misuse of 'the' to refer to specific objects known to both the speaker and the listener, or if it is used when the listener is expected to understand which specific object is meant because there is only one, or because it has been mentioned previously, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged.">
      <Example>Incorrect: "I saw the man with a telescope."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "I saw the man who was with a telescope."</Example>
      <Example>Incorrect: "The lions are dangerous species."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "The lion is a dangerous species."</Example>
    </SubType>
    <SubType name="Indefinite Article" description="If the error involves the misuse of 'a' or 'an', which are used to refer to non-specific objects or objects not previously known to the listener, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. Note that 'an' is used before vowels sounds for phonetic ease.">
      <Example>Incorrect: "She had a apple."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "She had an apple."</Example>
      <Example>Incorrect: "He is an university student."</Example>

Prompt:
    As an expert in English and Computer Science, interpret the provided XML FRAMEWORK or criteria and analyze the structured user input given as JSON. The JSON will contain a key-value pair with "line_number" as a line number, and "sentence" as the corresponding English input text. The text within the JSON is interconnected.
    Using the classification tags from the provided FRAMEWORK, apply all relevant tags to the JSON. You must accurately tag the sentences, identifying and assigning appropriate SubTypes for the MainType. Additionally, for every tag you apply, provide a detailed justification, explaining why each specific tag was chosen.

    Required actions :
    Tagging: "Using the provided criteria file or FRAMEWORK, begin by understanding the MainType outlined. Then, review the description of MainType and its associated SubTypes. Based on these descriptions, assign the appropriate MainType and SubType to each sentence. Some sentences may require multiple SubType tags, so ensure that all relevant tags are applied accurately. Stick strictly to the given FRAMEWORK and focus exclusively on identifying and tagging major errors. Do not offer any suggestions or corrections, just focus solely on tagging major errors."

    Rules for analysis: 
    "If a sentence does not fit any of the MainType and SubType, or if it contains errors that are not addressed by the established criteria—such as minor errors that do not significantly disrupt the overall meaning or the minor errors that only effect the clarity or conciseness of the sentence then you must write only "NONE" for both MainType and SubType. The aim is to ensure that only relevant major errors are identified and tagged for analysis."

    Justification: "Provide a detailed justification for each tag, explaining why a specific SubType has been applied. Clarify the reasons for tagging each sentence according to the provided criteria, ensuring that the rationale for selecting the particular SubType must be clear and logical. Justification must be according to the provided SubTypeTag and provide correction of SubTypeTag error as well in justification. Also output Correction of errors as 'Correction:'. If their is "NONE" in both MainType and SubType then you must write only "NONE" in Justification."

    Required output :
    The output must be structure as following CSV. Each opening CSV tag should close with proper closing tag.
