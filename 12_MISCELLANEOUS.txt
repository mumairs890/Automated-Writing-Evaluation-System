[FRAMEWORK]
<ErrorTypes>
    <MainType name="MISCELLANEOUS" description="If an error pertains to an unclassified element, such as an unconventional discourse marker, foreign word, interjection, or an incorrect application of prefixes or suffixes in writing, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged.">
        <SubType name="Discourse item" description="If the error involves misuse of discourse items that do not fit the standard academic or conversational markers, such as 'like', 'you know', 'I mean', 'actually', 'basically', or other colloquial discourse particles that are misplaced in formal writing, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. These elements are often used to add informality or conversational tone, which may not be suitable in formal or academic contexts.">
    <Example>Incorrect: "He was like, very smart."</Example>
    <Example>Correct: "He said he was very smart."</Example>
    <Example>Incorrect: "It's just like, I can't understand."</Example>
    <Example>Correct: "I just can't understand."</Example>
</SubType>

        <SubType name="Foreign word or expression" description="If a foreign word or phrase is used incorrectly or disruptively in an English text without proper integration or translation, such as misplaced 'cliché' or 'faux pas', assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged.">
            <Example>Incorrect: "His response was a complete faux pas."</Example>
            <Example>Correct: "His response was completely inappropriate."</Example>
            <Example>Incorrect: "She used many cliché in her essay."</Example>
            <Example>Correct: "She used many clichés in her essay."</Example>    
        </SubType>
       <SubType name="Interjection" description="If an interjection disrupts the flow of a formal text, or is used inappropriately in writing, such as 'wow', 'oops', 'ugh', 'ah', 'hey', and 'hmm', which are informal, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. These interjections are commonly used to express emotion or reaction in casual conversation but are generally inappropriate in formal academic or professional writing.">
    <Example>Incorrect: "Wow, that's a high score!"</Example>
    <Example>Correct: "That is an impressively high score."</Example>
    <Example>Incorrect: "Oops, I missed that detail."</Example>
    <Example>Correct: "I overlooked that detail."</Example>    
</SubType>

        <SubType name="Prepositioned bound morpheme (prefix)" description="If a prefix such as 'un-', 'mis-', 'dis-', 'over-', 'under-', 're-', 'pre-', 'post-', 'anti-', 'de-', or 'non-' is misapplied, resulting in semantically incorrect formations like 'unpossible', 'misunderstable', 'disunite', 'overexact', 'undermassive', 'reagree', 'preearly', 'postaft', 'antifor', 'deaccelerate', or 'nonunreal', assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. Incorrect use of these prefixes can significantly change the intended meaning, leading to inaccuracies in formal and academic texts.">
    <Example>Incorrect: "The results were unpossible to believe."</Example>
    <Example>Correct: "The results were impossible to believe."</Example>
    <Example>Incorrect: "He was very uncareful with the details."</Example>
    <Example>Correct: "He was very careless with the details."</Example>
    <Example>Incorrect: "This is a misunderstable comment."</Example>
    <Example>Correct: "This comment is understandable."</Example>
</SubType>

        <SubType name="Postpositioned bound morpheme (suffix)" description="If a suffix such as '-ness', '-ly', '-ful', '-less', '-ship', or '-hood' is misused, altering the intended grammatical category or meaning of the word, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. Examples of incorrect uses include using '-ness' to form a noun incorrectly ('sadlyness' from 'sadly'), '-ly' to form an adjective ('quickly' to mean 'quick'), '-ful' to create an awkward noun ('carefulness' used instead of 'care'), '-less' to negate a noun improperly ('hopeless' used to mean without 'hoping'), '-ship' where it does not belong ('friendship' used where 'friend' is intended), or '-hood' to form a nonstandard noun ('brotherhood' where 'brother' suffices).">
    <Example>Incorrect: "His sadlyness was evident."</Example>
    <Example>Correct: "His sadness was evident."</Example>
    <Example>Incorrect: "She showed great friendness."</Example>
    <Example>Correct: "She showed great friendliness."</Example>
    <Example>Incorrect: "She experienced a deep hopeless after the news."</Example>
    <Example>Correct: "She experienced deep hopelessness after the news."</Example>

Prompt:
    As an expert in English and Computer Science, interpret the provided XML framework or criteria and analyze the structured user input given as JSON. The JSON will contain a key-value pair with "line_number" as a line number, and "sentence" as the corresponding English input text. The text within the JSON is interconnected.
    Using the classification tags from the provided framework, apply all relevant tags to the JSON. You must accurately tag the sentences, identifying and assigning appropriate SubTypes for the MainType. Additionally, for every tag you apply, provide a detailed justification, explaining why each specific tag was chosen.

    Required actions :
    Tagging: "Using the provided criteria file or framework, begin by understanding the MainType outlined. Then, review the description of MainType and its associated SubTypes. Based on these descriptions, assign the appropriate MainType and SubType to each sentence. Some sentences may require multiple SubType tags, so ensure that all relevant tags are applied accurately. Stick strictly to the given FRAMEWORK and focus exclusively on identifying and tagging major errors. Do not offer any suggestions or corrections, just focus solely on tagging major errors."

    Rules for analysis: 
    "If a sentence does not fit any of the MainType and SubType, or if it contains errors that are not addressed by the established criteria—such as minor errors that do not significantly disrupt the overall meaning or the minor errors that only effect the clarity or conciseness of the sentence then you must write only "NONE" for both MainType and SubType. The aim is to ensure that only relevant major errors are identified and tagged for analysis."

    Justification: "Provide a detailed justification for each tag, explaining why a specific SubType has been applied. Clarify the reasons for tagging each sentence according to the provided criteria, ensuring that the rationale for selecting the particular SubType must be clear and logical. Justification must be according to the provided SubTypeTag and provide correction of SubTypeTag error as well in justification. Also output Correction of errors as 'Correction:'. If their is "NONE" in both MainType and SubType then you must write only "NONE" in Justification."

    Required output :
    The output must be structure as following CSV. Each opening CSV tag should close with proper closing tag.
