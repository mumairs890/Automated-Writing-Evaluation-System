FRAMEWORK/CRITERIA:
[FRAMEWORK]
<ErrorTypes>
    <MainType name="Punctuation" description="Tag errors only if they impact readability, meaning, or language convention adherence. Avoid tagging where punctuation usage does not affect comprehension. Include conditions and examples for each subtype to maintain consistency.">
        
        <SubType name="Missing Punctuation" description="Tag only if essential punctuation is omitted, causing ambiguity or disrupting flow. Focus on instances where missing punctuation (e.g., periods, commas, question marks, exclamation marks, colons, semicolons, quotation marks) affects sentence comprehension or intended meaning.">
            <Conditions>
                <Condition>Check for missing punctuation that links ideas (e.g., commas, semicolons) or clarifies meaning (e.g., quotation marks in direct speech).</Condition>
                <Condition>Tag if omission changes sentence meaning or creates a run-on sentence.</Condition>
            </Conditions>
            <Example>‘She said I don’t care’ (missing comma before 'I') – should be tagged as it changes intended meaning.</Example>
        </SubType>

        <SubType name="Redundant Punctuation" description="Tag if excessive punctuation disrupts readability or adds unintended emphasis. Avoid tagging if extra punctuation does not affect reading clarity.">
            <Conditions>
                <Condition>Identify cases of repetitive punctuation that cause distraction (e.g., multiple exclamation marks, ellipses).</Condition>
                <Condition>Leave untagged if extra punctuation does not obscure meaning or is stylistically appropriate.</Condition>
            </Conditions>
            <Example>‘This is amazing!!!’ (overuse of exclamation marks) – should be tagged if it distracts or adds unnecessary emphasis.</Example>
        </SubType>

        <SubType name="Confused Punctuation Marks" description="Tag if punctuation is used incorrectly, causing confusion in sentence boundaries or altering meaning (e.g., comma splice, misuse of dashes).">
            <Conditions>
                <Condition>Look for swapped punctuation marks (e.g., using a comma instead of a period) that mislead or create ambiguous phrasing.</Condition>
                <Condition>Tag if misuse causes a misinterpretation of sentence structure.</Condition>
            </Conditions>
            <Example>‘I went to the park, it was closed’ (comma splice) – should be tagged for clarity issues in sentence boundaries.</Example>
        </SubType>

Prompt:
    As an expert in English and Computer Science, interpret the provided XML framework or criteria and analyze the structured user input given as JSON. The JSON will contain a key-value pair with "line_number" as a line number, and "sentence" as the corresponding English input text. The text within the JSON is interconnected.
    Using the classification tags from the provided framework, apply all relevant tags to the JSON. You must accurately tag the sentences, identifying and assigning appropriate SubTypes for the MainType. Additionally, for every tag you apply, provide a detailed justification, explaining why each specific tag was chosen.

    Required actions :
    Tagging: "Using the provided criteria file or framework, begin by understanding the MainType outlined. Then, review the description of MainType and its associated SubTypes. Based on these descriptions, assign the appropriate MainType and SubType to each sentence. Some sentences may require multiple SubType tags, so ensure that all relevant tags are applied accurately. Stick strictly to the given FRAMEWORK and focus exclusively on identifying and tagging major errors. Do not offer any suggestions or corrections, just focus solely on tagging major errors."

    Rules for analysis: 
    "If a sentence does not fit any of the MainType and SubType, or if it contains errors that are not addressed by the established criteria—such as minor errors that do not significantly disrupt the overall meaning or the minor errors that only effect the clarity or conciseness of the sentence then you must write only "NONE" for both MainType and SubType. The aim is to ensure that only relevant major errors are identified and tagged for analysis."

    Justification: "Provide a detailed justification for each tag, explaining why a specific SubType has been applied. Clarify the reasons for tagging each sentence according to the provided criteria, ensuring that the rationale for selecting the particular SubType must be clear and logical. Justification must be according to the provided SubTypeTag and provide correction of SubTypeTag error as well in justification. Also output Correction of errors as 'Correction:'. If their is "NONE" in both MainType and SubType then you must write only "NONE" in Justification."

    Required output :
    The output must be structure as following CSV. Each opening CSV tag should close with proper closing tag.
