<ErrorTypes>
  <MainType name="PRONOUN" description="If an error is related to the incorrect or inappropriate use of a pronoun in any context, assign this tag; otherwise, leave the sentence untagged. This main type encompasses all pronoun errors. If the sentence uses a pronoun correctly, do not assign any tag.
First of all check the errored word is a PRONOUN or NOT using given conditions. If the errored word is PRONOUN and is used incorrectly then assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. 
Conditions:
1. If a word belongs to I, you, he, she, it, we, they, me, him, her, us, them and substitutes for a specific noun (or noun phrase) in a sentence, then it is a pronoun

2. If a word ends in -self or -selves (e.g., myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, themselves) and it refers back to the subject of the clause, then it is a pronoun

3. If a word stands alone to indicate possession—such as mine, yours, his, hers, its, ours, theirs and directly replaces a noun phrase (e.g., “That book is mine”), then it is a pronoun. (Note: Words like my, your, his, her, its, our, their are often “possessive adjectives” or “determiners” if they modify a noun rather than replace one. For instance, “my book” uses my as a determiner, not a pronoun.)

4. If a word is this, that, these, or those and stands alone to replace a noun (e.g., “This is interesting” rather than “This idea”), then it is a pronoun

5. If a word (e.g., someone, somebody, anyone, anybody, everyone, everybody, no one, nobody, nothing, something, one, none) appears by itself in place of a noun or noun phrase (“Everyone is invited,” “Something happened”), then it is a pronoun

6. If a word (e.g., who, whom, whose, what, which) is used in a question to represent an unknown noun or noun phrase (e.g., “Who is knocking?” “What happened?”), then it is a pronoun

7. If a word (e.g., who, whom, whose, which, that) is used to introduce a relative (adjective) clause and refers back to an antecedent (“The person who called you left a message”), then it is a pronoun

Key Reminder
Some words (e.g., that, which, those, what) can also function as determiners, adjectives, or other parts of speech. They are only pronouns if they stand alone and directly take the place of a noun or noun phrase.

    <SubType name="Anticipatory it"
         description="If there is a misuse of 'it' functioning as a placeholder (expletive) subject before the true subject (often an infinitive or clause) appears later in the sentence, assign this tag; otherwise, leave the sentence untagged. Anticipatory 'it' is typically used to introduce or delay the real subject for stylistic or structural reasons (e.g., 'It is important that you attend.'). 

Common mistakes include:
• Omitting 'it' when the sentence structure requires it (e.g., 'Is important that you attend.').
• Placing 'it' in the wrong position in the sentence, causing grammatical or clarity issues.

If 'it' is used correctly as a placeholder, or if the sentence does not require an anticipatory structure and therefore does not need 'it,' do not assign this tag.">

Prompt:
    As an expert in English and Computer Science, interpret the provided XML FRAMEWORK or criteria and analyze the structured user input given as JSON. The JSON will contain a key-value pair with "line_number" as a line number, and "sentence" as the corresponding English input text. The text within the JSON is interconnected.
    Using the classification tags from the provided FRAMEWORK, apply all relevant tags to the JSON. You must accurately tag the sentences, identifying and assigning appropriate SubTypes for the MainType. Additionally, for every tag you apply, provide a detailed justification, explaining why each specific tag was chosen.

    Required actions :
    Tagging: "Using the provided criteria file or FRAMEWORK, begin by understanding the MainType outlined. Then, review the description of MainType and its associated SubTypes. Based on these descriptions, assign the appropriate MainType and SubType to each sentence. Some sentences may require multiple SubType tags, so ensure that all relevant tags are applied accurately. Stick strictly to the given FRAMEWORK and focus exclusively on identifying and tagging major errors. Do not offer any suggestions or corrections, just focus solely on tagging major errors."

    Rules for analysis: 
    "If a sentence does not fit any of the MainType and SubType, or if it contains errors that are not addressed by the established criteria—such as minor errors that do not significantly disrupt the overall meaning or the minor errors that only effect the clarity or conciseness of the sentence then you must write only "NONE" for both MainType and SubType. The aim is to ensure that only relevant major errors are identified and tagged for analysis. Before tagging, understand the context of previous sentences."

    Justification: "Provide a detailed justification for each tag, explaining why a specific SubType has been applied. Clarify the reasons for tagging each sentence according to the provided criteria, ensuring that the rationale for selecting the particular SubType must be clear and logical. Justification must be according to the provided SubTypeTag and provide correction of SubTypeTag error as well in justification. Also output Correction of errors as 'Correction:'. If their is "NONE" in both MainType and SubType then you must write only "NONE" in Justification."

    Required output :
    The output must be structure as following CSV. Each opening CSV tag should close with proper closing tag.
