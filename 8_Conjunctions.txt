<ErrorTypes>
  <MainType name="Conjunction" description="If an error involves the inappropriate use, form, or placement of a conjunction within a sentence, affecting its logical structure or clarity, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged.
First of all check the errored word is a Conjunction or NOT using given conditions. If the errored word is Conjunction and is used incorrectly then assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. 
Conditions:
1. If a word is used specifically to link two independent clauses without modifying either clause, then it is a coordinating conjunction.
Example: If "but" links "I wanted to go" and "it was raining" in "I wanted to go, but it was raining," then "but" is a coordinating conjunction.

2. If a word introduces a clause that cannot function as a complete sentence on its own and connects it to an independent clause, then it is a subordinating conjunction.
Example: If "because" introduces "her train was delayed" in "She was late because her train was delayed," then "because" is a subordinating conjunction.

3. If a word connects items within the same category (like nouns, verbs, adjectives) in a list format, then it is a conjunction, usually a coordinating type.
Example: If "and" joins "apples" and "oranges" in "I bought apples and oranges," then "and" is a conjunction.

4. If a word is placed before the last item in a series to offer alternatives or choices, then it is typically a coordinating conjunction.
Example: If "or" appears in "You can choose to stay or leave," offering a choice, then "or" is a conjunction.

5. If a word primarily serves to express logical relationships such as reason, condition, or time between clauses, and it is not functioning as a preposition, then it is a conjunction.
Example: If "after" links "she finished her work" to "she went home" in "She went home after she finished her work," establishing a time relationship, then "after" is a subordinating conjunction.">
    <SubType name="Coordinating Conjunction" description="If a coordinating conjunction (e.g., 'and', 'but', 'or', 'nor', 'for', 'yet', 'so') that links words, phrases, or independent clauses within a sentence is misused, resulting in a disruption of logical flow or an unclear connection between components, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. Ensure that the error specifically pertains to the use of a coordinating conjunction and does not involve subordinating conjunctions or other grammatical elements.">
	<Example>Incorrect: "She went to the store, yet bought nothing." (Misuse of 'yet'; 'and' fits better as there is no contrast)</Example>
	<Example>Correct: "She went to the store and bought nothing."</Example>
	<Example>Incorrect: "He enjoys playing football, or basketball." (Misuse of 'or'; 'and' would be appropriate as there is no choice implied)</Example>
	<Example>Correct: "He enjoys playing football and basketball."</Example>
    </SubType>
    <SubType name="Subordinating Conjunction" description="If a subordinating conjunction (e.g., 'although', 'because', 'if', 'while', 'whereas', 'after', 'before', 'since', 'until', 'when') is used in such a way that it introduces ambiguity or misleads regarding the logical or temporal relationship between the clauses it connects, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. This tag should be applied strictly to errors arising from the inappropriate use of subordinating conjunctions, without overlapping with issues related to coordinating conjunctions or punctuation errors.">
	<Example>Incorrect: "They will not leave if they don’t finish." (Misuse of 'if'; 'until' is needed to indicate the condition must be met first)</Example>
	<Example>Correct: "They will not leave until they finish."</Example>
	<Example>Incorrect: "Although he was early, he missed the bus." (Misuse of 'although'; implies contradiction, whereas 'because' fits better)</Example>
	<Example>Correct: "He missed the bus because he was early."</Example>

Prompt:
    As an expert in English and Computer Science, interpret the provided XML framework or criteria and analyze the structured user input given as JSON. The JSON will contain a key-value pair with "line_number" as a line number, and "sentence" as the corresponding English input text. The text within the JSON is interconnected.
    Using the classification tags from the provided framework, apply all relevant tags to the JSON. You must accurately tag the sentences, identifying and assigning appropriate SubTypes for the MainType. Additionally, for every tag you apply, provide a detailed justification, explaining why each specific tag was chosen.

    Required actions :
    Tagging: "Using the provided criteria file or framework, begin by understanding the MainType outlined. Then, review the description of MainType and its associated SubTypes. Based on these descriptions, assign the appropriate MainType and SubType to each sentence. Some sentences may require multiple SubType tags, so ensure that all relevant tags are applied accurately. Stick strictly to the given FRAMEWORK and focus exclusively on identifying and tagging major errors. Do not offer any suggestions or corrections, just focus solely on tagging major errors."

    Rules for analysis: 
    "If a sentence does not fit any of the MainType and SubType, or if it contains errors that are not addressed by the established criteria—such as minor errors that do not significantly disrupt the overall meaning or the minor errors that only effect the clarity or conciseness of the sentence then you must write only "NONE" for both MainType and SubType. The aim is to ensure that only relevant major errors are identified and tagged for analysis."

    Justification: "Provide a detailed justification for each tag, explaining why a specific SubType has been applied. Clarify the reasons for tagging each sentence according to the provided criteria, ensuring that the rationale for selecting the particular SubType must be clear and logical. Justification must be according to the provided SubTypeTag and provide correction of SubTypeTag error as well in justification. Also output Correction of errors as 'Correction:'. If their is "NONE" in both MainType and SubType then you must write only "NONE" in Justification."

    Required output :
    The output must be structure as following CSV. Each opening CSV tag should close with proper closing tag.
