FRAMEWORK/CRITERIA:
[FRAMEWORK]
<ErrorTypes>
  <MainType name="Lexical Verb" description="If an error occurs related to the main action or state expressed by the verb in the sentence, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. Lexical verbs are main verbs in a sentence that carry the primary meaning, indicating actions, states, or occurrences." >
    
    <SubType name="Intransitive Verb" description="If an error occurs where a verb is used without a direct object to complete its meaning, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. Intransitive verbs do not require a direct object to complete their action. They express actions or states that do not transfer to an object. Intransitive verbs often describe actions of the subject that do not affect another entity directly. Examples of intransitive verbs include: 'run', 'sleep', 'arrive', 'exist', 'belong', etc.">
      <Example>Incorrect: "She sleeps the whole day."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "She sleeps the whole day." (Correct usage: 'sleeps' is an intransitive verb; no object is required.)</Example>
      <Example>Incorrect: "The dog runs the park."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "The dog runs in the park." (Correct usage: 'runs' should not take an object in this case.)</Example>    
    </SubType>
    
    <SubType name="Copular Verb" description="If an error occurs where the verb is misused to link the subject to a subject complement or predicate adjective, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. Copular verbs (also known as linking verbs) do not express actions. Instead, they link the subject with its complement (a noun, adjective, or prepositional phrase that provides more information about the subject). Examples of copular verbs include: 'be', 'seem', 'become', 'appear', 'feel', 'look', etc.">
      <Example>Incorrect: "He is looks tired."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "He looks tired." (Correct usage: 'looks' functions as a linking verb here.)</Example>
      <Example>Incorrect: "The cake was tastes delicious."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "The cake tastes delicious." (Correct usage: 'tastes' as a copular verb does not require 'was'.)</Example>    
    </SubType>

    <SubType name="Monotransitive Verb" description="If an error occurs where a verb requires only one direct object but is incorrectly used with either too many or no objects, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. Monotransitive verbs take only one direct object to complete the meaning of the sentence. These verbs can’t be used without an object. Examples of monotransitive verbs include: 'eat', 'see', 'write', 'call', 'buy', etc.">
      <Example>Incorrect: "She bought the book quickly."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "She bought a book quickly." (Correct usage: 'bought' is a monotransitive verb; it requires only a single object.)</Example>
      <Example>Incorrect: "She saw yesterday the man."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "She saw the man yesterday." (Correct usage: 'saw' takes only one object: 'the man'.)</Example>    
    </SubType>

    <SubType name="Ditransitive Verb" description="If an error occurs where a verb that takes both a direct object and an indirect object is used incorrectly, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. Ditransitive verbs require two objects: a direct object (the receiver of the action) and an indirect object (the entity for whom or to whom the action is performed). Examples of ditransitive verbs include: 'give', 'send', 'show', 'offer', 'tell', etc.">
      <Example>Incorrect: "She gave quickly him a gift."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "She gave him a gift quickly." (Correct usage: 'gave' requires both 'him' and 'a gift' as the two objects.)</Example>
      <Example>Incorrect: "I offered a book to him."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "I offered him a book." (Correct usage: 'offered' is ditransitive and requires two objects.)</Example>    
    </SubType>

    <SubType name="Dimonotransitive Verb" description="If an error occurs where a verb requires two direct objects but one is missing or misused, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. Dimonotransitive verbs take two direct objects in a sentence. These verbs are not common, but their structure requires both objects to complete the meaning. Examples of dimonotransitive verbs include: 'put', 'place', 'show', 'teach', etc.">
      <Example>Incorrect: "She placed on the table the book."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "She placed the book on the table." (Correct usage: 'placed' requires two direct objects: 'the book' and 'on the table'.)</Example>
      <Example>Incorrect: "He put the letter in the mailbox."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "He put the letter into the mailbox." (Correct usage: 'put' functions with two direct objects—'the letter' and 'into the mailbox'.)</Example>    
    </SubType>

    <SubType name="Complex Transitive Verb" description="If an error occurs where a verb requires both a direct object and an additional element (either an object complement or adverbial phrase) to complete the meaning, assign this tag; otherwise, leave it untagged. Complex transitive verbs require both a direct object and either an object complement (e.g., adjective, noun) or a prepositional phrase to give full sense. Examples of complex transitive verbs include: 'make', 'find', 'call', 'consider', 'appoint', etc.">
      <Example>Incorrect: "She considered carefully the proposal."</Example>
      <Example>Correct: "She considered the proposal carefully." (Correct usage: 'considered' requires a direct object 'the proposal' and a modifier 'carefully'.)</Example>
      <Example>Incorrect: "They called their dog barking." </Example>
      <Example>Correct: "They called their dog barking loudly." (Correct usage: 'called' requires both the direct object 'their dog' and an object complement like 'barking loudly'.)</Example>

Prompt:
    As an expert in English and Computer Science, interpret the provided XML framework or criteria and analyze the structured user input given as JSON. The JSON will contain a key-value pair with "line_number" as a line number, and "sentence" as the corresponding English input text. The text within the JSON is interconnected.
    Using the classification tags from the provided framework, apply all relevant tags to the JSON. You must accurately tag the sentences, identifying and assigning appropriate SubTypes for the MainType. Additionally, for every tag you apply, provide a detailed justification, explaining why each specific tag was chosen.

    Required actions :
    Tagging: "Using the provided criteria file or framework, begin by understanding the MainType outlined. Then, review the description of MainType and its associated SubTypes. Based on these descriptions, assign the appropriate MainType and SubType to each sentence. Some sentences may require multiple SubType tags, so ensure that all relevant tags are applied accurately. Stick strictly to the given FRAMEWORK and focus exclusively on identifying and tagging major errors. Do not offer any suggestions or corrections, just focus solely on tagging major errors."

    Rules for analysis: 
    "If a sentence does not fit any of the MainType and SubType, or if it contains errors that are not addressed by the established criteria—such as minor errors that do not significantly disrupt the overall meaning or the minor errors that only effect the clarity or conciseness of the sentence then you must write only "NONE" for both MainType and SubType. The aim is to ensure that only relevant major errors are identified and tagged for analysis."

    Justification: "Provide a detailed justification for each tag, explaining why a specific SubType has been applied. Clarify the reasons for tagging each sentence according to the provided criteria, ensuring that the rationale for selecting the particular SubType must be clear and logical. Justification must be according to the provided SubTypeTag and provide correction of SubTypeTag error as well in justification. Also output Correction of errors as 'Correction:'. If there is "NONE" in both MainType and SubType then you must write only "NONE" in Justification."

    Required output :
    The output must be structure as following CSV. Each opening CSV tag should close with proper closing tag.
